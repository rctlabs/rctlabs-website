      question: "How are the RCT Labs algorithms organized?",
      answer:
        "The 41 proprietary algorithms are grouped into 9 capability tiers: Foundation (4), Analysis (5), Reasoning (5), Orchestration (4), Verification (5), Memory (4), Adaptation (5), Synthesis (5), and Autonomy (4). Each tier extends the one below it.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is Analysearch?",
      answer:
        "Analysearch is RCT Labs' proprietary multi-depth analysis and synthesis engine. It operates in four modes — Quick (<200ms), Standard (2–5s), Deep (10–30s), and Mirror (15–45s) — each activating different algorithm tiers to match the required reasoning depth.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between Quick, Standard, Deep, and Mirror modes in Analysearch?",
      answer:
        "Quick mode returns a direct cached or pattern-matched answer in under 200ms using Tier 1–2 algorithms. Standard adds multi-source evidence grading at 2–5s. Deep runs cross-domain synthesis for comprehensive research-grade output at 10–30s. Mirror adds a JITNA-based Socratic challenge and consensus merge at 15–45s for maximum accuracy.",
    },
    {
      question: "What validates the 41-algorithm framework?",
      answer:
        "The algorithm framework is validated by 4,849 automated tests across the full RCT Ecosystem, producing a measured hallucination rate of 0.3% against a 12–15% industry average. Each tier is gated by benchmark tests before activation in production.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the algorithm tier system relate to the RCT 10-layer architecture?",
      answer:
        "The 9 algorithm tiers map directly into the RCT 10-layer cognitive architecture. Tier 1–2 algorithms operate in the foundation and perception layers, Tier 3–5 in the reasoning and verification layers, Tier 6–7 in the memory and adaptation layers, and Tier 8–9 in the synthesis and autonomy layers.",
